# Agent Platform

A **turnâ€‘key starter kit** that pairs Googleâ€™s **Agent Development Kit** with a
Planner â†’ Coder â†’ Reviewer workflow, preâ€‘wired CI, and a minimal SOP. Spin up
an LLMâ€‘powered assistant capable of opening pullâ€‘requests, writing debriefs,
and passing CI on its own.

## Quickâ€‘start

```bash
# 1. Clone the template into your new project folder
git clone https://github.com/ianlucas1/agent_platform.git my-app
cd my-app

# 2. Oneâ€‘shot environment setup
./scripts/bootstrap.sh   # installs Python, Node, ADK, MCP servers

# 3. List pending roadmap tasks
python scripts/parse_roadmap.py
```

## Roadmap

Project progress lives in **`configs/ROADMAP_TODO.md`**.
Run `python scripts/parse_roadmap.py` to see tasks with `status=pending`.
Use `python scripts/status_updater.py <id> <status>` to flip a task to
`in_progress` or `done`.

## Contributing

* Follow the workflow & coding standards in **LLM_COLLABORATOR.md** and **AGENTS.md**.  
* Branch names must start with `codex/â€¦` so the Codex UI shows **Push â–¾ / CreateÂ PR**.  
* Pass Ruffâ€¯Â·â€¯Blackâ€¯Â·â€¯Bandit linters (and `pytest -q` once tests exist) before committing.  
* Update docs and tick the roadmap when you complete a task.

* See **docs/prompt_templates/** for readyâ€‘made assumptionâ€‘check and tasking prompts.
* See docs/knowledge/mcp_servers.md for a quick guide to starting the local MCP servers.
* See docs/lessons/README.md for a timeline of project lessons & retrospectives.

## Offline & sandbox quirks

Codexâ€™s sandbox disables outbound network after the setup script finishes.
`scripts/bootstrap.sh` installs all dependencies **before** the cutoff and
exports `NO_NET=1` so subsequent commands run offline.  
Outside Codex you get full internet; the repo simply ensures the same code also
works in the stricter sandbox.
