# FS16 Debrief – Status-Updater, Smoke-Test & CI Drift Guard  
*2025-05-20*

## What shipped
| Area | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| Tooling | `scripts/status_updater.py` – CLI to flip roadmap comment + checkbox |
| Tests | `tests/test_status_updater.py` smoke-test (in-progress ⇄ done) |
| CI | `scripts/check_roadmap_sync.py` + bootstrap step → fails if roadmap drifts |
| Automation | `status_updater` used to mark FS16 milestones throughout the run |
| Repo hygiene | `bootstrap.sh` parity, +x on MCP scripts, added Bandit/PyTest reqs |
| Docs | Collaborator guide & prompt-template synced with new rules |

## Key lessons
* **Parallel Branching** – splitting B1-B6 let Codex work concurrently without merge conflicts; repeat for future multi-file tasks.  
* **Assumptions Check** – branch-rename step removed; table now focuses on byte-level `bootstrap.sh`, exec bits, linters, and roadmap status.  
* **CI Drift Guard** – early failure surfaced stale roadmap metadata; keep comment ↔ checkbox in sync to avoid red builds.  
* **Review Brevity** – human wants only “✓ good to push” or blocking issues; rule 12 added to *LLM_COLLABORATOR.md*.  
* **Artifact Triage** – new UI tip: always parse Codex summary, diff, and logs for hidden warnings that affect CI or prompting clarity.

## Follow-ups
1. Close FS16 on `main` (`status_updater FS16 done`) – *mandatory*  
2. Merge doc-sync PR that updates Collaborator guide – *open*  
3. Kick off FS17 (FileSystem tool) once CI is green.
