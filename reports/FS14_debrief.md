# FS14 Debrief ‚Äì Bootstrap CI Workflow (Resolved May 20, 2025)

## Objective

Create a cross-platform CI job to:
- Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` on Ubuntu and macOS GitHub runners
- Validate code health using `ruff`, `black`, and `bandit`
- Ensure reproducibility, executable integrity, and CI compatibility

## Outcome

‚úÖ CI workflow added  
‚úÖ Bootstrap script hardened  
‚úÖ FS14 marked complete  
‚úÖ CI passes across all platforms

## Failures and Lessons Learned

### 1. üî• Permission Errors from Git Mode Drift

**What happened:**
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh` lost its `+x` permission in Git repeatedly.
- Even though `chmod +x` was applied locally, it wasn‚Äôt staged via:
  ```bash
  git update-index --chmod=+x scripts/bootstrap.sh
  ```

* This caused CI to fail silently or with `exit code 126`.

**Resolution:**

* Explicitly committed the mode using `update-index`.
* Added a CI `chmod +x` step as a backup in the workflow.

**Lesson:**
File system `chmod` ‚â† Git mode. Always commit mode with `update-index`.

---

### 2. üß© PEP 668 Breakage on macOS (pip install)

**What happened:**

* macOS runners use Homebrew Python with PEP 668, which blocks global pip installs.
* CI failed silently unless `PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1` was exported.

**Resolution:**

* Added:

  ```bash
  export PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1
  ```

  inside the `Darwin` block of `scripts/bootstrap.sh`.

**Lesson:**
macOS bootstrap requires the above export or pip will silently refuse installs.

### 3. üåÄ Codex UI Instability

**What happened:**

* Multiple Codex sessions completed the shell work, but failed to surface the push button.
* Codex sometimes amended commits on the wrong branch (`work`, `main`, or post-merge `HEAD`).
* Tasking often failed with ‚Äúunknown error‚Äù after successful execution.

**Resolution:**

* Reset FS14 under a new branch: `capx/FS14-bootstrap-ci-reboot`
* Avoided `--amend`, started clean from `main`

**Lesson:**

* Never amend Codex commits unless absolutely necessary
* Restart clean from `main` if tasking repeatedly fails

### 4. üß† Debrief Trigger for Future Agents

FS14‚Äôs CI bootstrapping revealed the need for pre-FS15 hygiene enforcement:

* Mode validation
* Lockfiles
* README/ROADMAP sync
* LICENSE presence
* `run_tasks.py` removal

These are now encapsulated in:

* `ROADMAP_TODO.md` ‚Üí FS14.5
* `docs/fs14.5_plan.md`
* `DEEP_RESEARCH.md` SOP section
