# FS14.5 – Repo Hygiene & Onboarding Prep

This task ensures the repo is stable, reproducible, and contributor-friendly before continuing with FS15+ feature work. It addresses gaps surfaced during FS14 and in external audit reports.

## Why This Matters

Codex and Deep Research agents have hit issues with:

- Non-executable scripts
- Missing or broken references in README
- Pip install failures due to yanked versions
- CI regressions from improper bootstrap mode handling
- Lack of clarity for new contributors

Cleaning these now prevents deeper failures as task automation expands.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Enforce `+x` mode on all `.sh` files and confirm Git sees them as `100755`
- [ ] Add `LICENSE` file to enable external contributions
- [ ] Generate and commit lockfiles:
  - `requirements.lock` or pip freeze
  - `package-lock.json` for Node
- [ ] Remove or implement `scripts/run_tasks.py` (referenced in README but not present)
- [ ] Sync task status between `README.md` and `configs/ROADMAP_TODO.md`
- [ ] Fix triple backtick mismatch in README quickstart block
- [ ] Add a simple "Planner → Coder → Reviewer" diagram to `README.md` or `AGENTS.md`

## Notes

This task can be completed by a single Codex agent or split into subtasks if needed. Agents should stage all fixes in a feature branch:  
`capx/FS14.5-repo-hygiene`

Once done, mark this task as complete in `ROADMAP_TODO.md`.
