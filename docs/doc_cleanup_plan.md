# Documentation Cleanup Plan

This repository keeps historical documents under `docs/archive/` while active docs stay in `docs/`. The table below summarizes planned moves:

| Document | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `implementation_roadmap.md` | Move to `docs/archive/2025-05/` |
| `docs/lessons/*` | Keep and index via `docs/lessons/README.md` |
| Old capability reports | Archive under `docs/archive/2025-05/` |

New docs such as prompt templates and docstring style guidelines will live under `docs/prompt_templates/` and `docs/style/` respectively.
