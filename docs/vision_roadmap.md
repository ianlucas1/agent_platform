# Vision – Autonomous Development Agent Platform

An **autonomous development agent platform** that can clone, build, and iteratively improve any codebase with minimal human intervention. The long‑term goal is a single‑command UX:

```bash
cap run "Your high‑level goal"
```

The agent then:

1. Plans tasks, executes code changes, tests, and opens PRs with summaries.  
2. Produces deterministic, reproducible runs (pinned deps, green CI).  
3. Maintains a transparent ledger: every task yields a concise debrief file and PR.

Safety & openness are core: only MIT/Apache‑licensed code is assimilated, and security checks (Bandit, etc.) run on every PR.

As the platform evolves it will orchestrate multiple specialized agents (Planner → Coder → Reviewer), self‑debug on failure, and remain human‑review‑first.

## Roadmap phases

*See `docs/todo_tasks.md` for detailed task breakdown.*

| Phase | Tasks | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Deterministic Pipeline** | FS16‑FS22 | End‑to‑end task automation (status updater, filesystem/GitHub tools, task loop, auto‑PR, debrief). |
| **Strategic Power‑ups** | FS23‑FS29 | Search & debug tools, session memory, multi‑agent loop. |
| **Plugin Assimilation** | FS30‑FS35 | Discover, sandbox, benchmark, and auto‑integrate plugins; nightly “Borg” routine. |
| **Beyond** | – | Self‑healing, larger multi‑agent orchestration. |
